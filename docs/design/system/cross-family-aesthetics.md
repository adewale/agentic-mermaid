## 0. The one load-bearing mechanism

Radar became beautiful **without touching the styling engine**. It added *zero* new
scene roles and *zero* new mark kinds, lowered its marks onto existing roles —
`pie-slice` (fill), `grid` (rings/spokes), `point` (dots), `axis`, `legend`, `title` —
and inherited hand-drawn sketch, watercolor wash, text halos, 21 palettes × 16 looks,
DOM identity and accessibility **for free**. The backends dispatch purely on
`sceneRoleTraits(node.role)`, never on the diagram family (`src/scene/rough-backend.ts:446-459`;
`src/scene/backend.ts`).

> **Beauty here is a property of (a) the roles a family assigns to its marks and
> (b) a handful of paint/measurement disciplines — not of family-specific rendering
> code.** Every lesson below is a corollary.

Encouraging finding from the survey: all 14 other families are *already* fully
scene-lowered, palette-swappable through the `DiagramColors` waist, and deterministic.
So this is a plan of narrow, concrete role-tag and paint changes — not rewrites.

---

## 1. The union of lessons (the canonical checklist)

Radar contributed ten lessons. The families that beat radar contribute six more
disciplines that *upgrade* radar's own label lesson. The **union** is the bar every
family should now be held to — not "did you copy radar's move" but "did you apply the
best-in-repo technique for each concern."

### Radar's ten (L1–L10)

| # | Lesson | Why it produces beauty |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Signature shape → a `sketch:'shape'` role** | A ruler-perfect primary glyph beside wobbly boxes reads as broken; the sketch look coheres only if the defining element gets the treatment. |
| L2 | **Scaffold → a `sketch:'none'` role (recedes)** | Lively translucent data reads only on a quiet ground; a jittery scaffold turns overlaps into noise. |
| L3 | **Categorical color from the shared `pieSliceColors`** (hue-spread >6) | One color language across all charts; palette swaps recolor free; N categories stay *distinguishable* instead of collapsing to shades of one hue. |
| L4 | **Translucent fill + crisp bg-stroked marker** | Translucency lets overlaps blend legibly; the bg-stroked bead keeps the precise data point sharp on a busy ground ("the sketch marks the measurement"). |
| L5 | **Measure-then-reserve gutters** (wrap; widen for title) | Clipping is the loudest "unfinished" signal; reserving space *before* the plot expands keeps the composition whole at any label length. |
| L6 | **Single-scale contract** (resolve auto-max once; degenerate → throw) | A chart whose SVG and ASCII clamp differently, or that emits NaN, is broken; beauty presupposes the floor. |
| L7 | **Wire-or-warn every config/theme knob** | A knob that silently does nothing yields surprising, un-tunable renders; also stops silent color corruption. |
| L8 | **Honest ASCII degradation** (same palette + scale) | The same diagram reads with the same color language in SVG and terminal. |
| L9 | **Plan + an explicit aesthetic thesis** ("the silhouette IS the message") | The rubric measures only a hygiene floor; the aesthetic ceiling comes from a deliberate per-family thesis, not from chasing rubric points. |
| L10 | **Quality-gate plumbing** (box/mark lever, `<path>` trick, honest exemptions) | Lets *legitimate* by-design overlap coexist with a rubric that would otherwise flag it, so a family can be beautiful *and* pass the gate. |

### The reverse-flow disciplines (R1–R6) — where other families beat radar

These make L5 (and L4/L7) stronger than radar's own implementation:

| # | Discipline | Source family | Beats radar's… |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **Active label de-collision** — walk the route, offset in the normal lane, reject overlaps vs other labels, boxes, off-canvas, endpoint zones (`separateRelationshipLabels`, `er/renderer.ts:481-553`) | ER | …*static* gutter reserve. |
| R2 | **Leader-line dense-label placement** — spiral of rings×angles with collision boxes + leaders to far slots (`quadrant/layout.ts:138-213`) | quadrant | …no way to place a label clear of the plot. |
| R3 | **Vertical row reservation + repair-then-surface** — `rowAdvance` grows the row for a wrapped block; place label left/right/column else surface (`gantt/layout.ts:600`, `gantt/renderer.ts:410-435`) | gantt | …horizontal-only gutter sizing. |
| R4 | **Budget-driven compression** — a second metric pass with proportionally compressed wrap caps to hit a width budget (`timeline/layout.ts:169-185`) | timeline | …a fixed 96px wrap cap. |
| R5 | **Bordered knockout label box** — a real `fill:var(--bg)` box with a hairline behind text over busy fills (`flowchart renderer.ts:721-733`) | flowchart | …a bare paint-order text halo. |
| R6 | **WCAG-AA contrast gate on label ink** — honor an author/label color only if it clears 4.5:1 on its composited ground (`contrastGuardedLabelColor`, `journey/renderer.ts:836-852`) | journey | …ungated ring/axis label ink. |

Also in the union, credited below: pie's **largest-first legend admission**
(`pie/layout.ts:321-378`), mindmap's **depth-alpha recession** (`mindmap/renderer.ts:98`),
gitgraph's **rotated-bounds axis packing** + **resolve-once boundary**
(`gitgraph/layout.ts:44-64`, `position.ts:4-9`).

**Implication of the union.** L5 is no longer "reserve a gutter." Held to the union,
the label concern becomes: *wrap to a budget (radar) → compress the budget if still too
wide (R4) → de-collide what remains (R1) → leader-line anything that can't fit in place
(R2) → reserve vertical room for the wrapped block (R3) → knockout-box it over busy
fills (R5) → gate the ink for contrast (R6).* Each family should reach for the highest
rung its content needs. Radar sits near the bottom of that ladder today; §4 shows what
it looks like near the top.

## 2. The families that beat radar (the reverse flow)

Radar codified a house style; it did not invent every discipline in it. Several
families are strictly ahead of radar on specific concerns and are the models to copy:

| Family | What it does better than radar | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **ER** | **Active, deterministic label de-collision** — relocates colliding relationship labels against other labels, entity boxes, off-canvas, *and* reserved crow's-foot zones. Radar only reserves static gutters. | `er/renderer.ts:481-553` |
| **quadrant** | **2-pass gutter solve** + **spiral-of-10-rings×16-angles** point-label placement with **leader lines** and a wrap→ellipsize fallback. More sophisticated than radar's label handling. | `quadrant/layout.ts:138-213, 261-282` |
| **gantt** | **`rowAdvance`** reserves *vertical* space per wrapped multi-line label; **repair-then-surface** collision handler; rich per-mark semantic channels (`status/progress/emphasis/category`). Fullest realization of L5 in the repo. | `gantt/layout.ts:557-601`, `gantt/renderer.ts:410-435, 483-505` |
| **flowchart/state** | **Bordered knockout background box** for labels (reads better than a bare halo over busy fills) + **iterative route-collision repair** at the ELK level + `namespaceSvgIds`. | `renderer.ts:721-733`, `route-contracts.ts:45,816` |
| **gitgraph** | **Measured-extent axis packing** with `rotateBoxBounds` for 45° labels, then grow-the-canvas; **resolve-font-size-once** boundary (mirrors `resolveRadarScale`). | `gitgraph/layout.ts:44-64,120-142`, `position.ts:4-9` |
| **timeline** | **Budget-driven two-pass width compression** — stronger than radar's fixed cap; single-walk LR/TD axis frame. | `timeline/layout.ts:169-185` |
| **mindmap** | **Per-side independent-column** 2-pass gutter sizing; **depth-alpha recession** (fills tint toward bg by depth). | `mindmap/layout.ts:120-155`, `renderer.ts:98` |
| **pie** | **Largest-first label collision admission** + measure-then-size-the-canvas legend. The canonical `pieSliceColors`. | `pie/layout.ts:321-378`, `pie/renderer.ts:93` |
| **journey** | **bg-ring bead** + golden-angle actor wheel (both predate radar) + **WCAG-AA label gate**. | `journey/renderer.ts:289,836-852` |

---

## 3. What happens when we apply them — radar before/after (delivered)

Radar reserved *static* gutters and painted ring values as bare text on the gap ray, so a
multi-line axis label on a spoke whose data reached the outer ring **overlapped the
silhouette** (the straight-down "Safety…" label), and the tick values washed out over the
rings. Absorbing the reverse-flow disciplines (R1–R6) fixes both — real renders, same data:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| ![radar before](../families/radar-reverse-lessons-before.png) | ![radar after](../families/radar-reverse-lessons-after.png) |

*Real renderer output from [`radar-reverse-lessons-demo.mmd`](../families/radar-reverse-lessons-demo.mmd);
regenerate the "after" with `bun run scripts/pr-assets/radar-reverse-lessons.ts`.*

| Concern | Before | After | Borrowed from |
|---|---|---|---|
| A multi-line label on a maxed-out spoke | **overlaps the silhouette** | radial **clearance** pushes it clear; a **leader line** reconnects it | ER R1 · quadrant R2 |
| Adjacent labels on many axes | can collide | **pairwise de-collision** (verified to 24 tight axes) | ER R1 |
| Ring value labels | bare gray text, wash out | **page-colored knockout pills** + **WCAG-AA ink** | flowchart R5 · journey R6 |
| A very long axis label | fixed 96px wrap only | **budget-driven wrap compression** + ellipsize fallback | timeline R4 |
| A long legend label | column just widens | **wrapped with reserved row height** | gantt R3 |

Everything else radar already did well (silhouette, palette, translucency, dots — free from
L1–L4). This is delivered in `src/radar/{layout,renderer,types}.ts`; each discipline has a
geometry/structure invariant in `src/__tests__/radar-label-discipline.test.ts` that fails
when reverted, and the canvas grows to contain every final box so nothing clips. `bun run
track` radar score rose to **100 (+0.6), 0 regressions**.

## 4. The improvement plan — ranked cross-family moves

Ranked by (beauty win × breadth) ÷ risk. Moves 1–8 are role-tag or paint-only:
localized, deterministic-safe, and they inherit the rest of the house style for free.

1. **Move each family's signature glyph off `chrome`/`raw`/`<defs>` onto a
   `sketch:'shape'`/`point` role** (L1) — the single most cross-cutting gap.
   Ordered: mindmap node body (`mindmap/renderer.ts:108`), class UML markers
   (`class/renderer.ts:159-170`, visually dominant), gitgraph commit markers
   (`gitgraph/renderer.ts:129`), architecture icons (`architecture/renderer.ts:505`),
   er crow's-foot (`er/renderer.ts:639`). Decide each opt-out *on purpose*.
2. **Give quadrant points categorical color** from the shared palette (L3) —
   `quadrant/renderer.ts:229`; add a restrained `legend`.
3. **Default timeline section colors** from `pieSliceColors` when unconfigured (L3) —
   `timeline/renderer.ts:522-542`. Timeline is the one family that inherits the palette's
   *look* but stays gray under swaps.
4. **Swap `getSeriesColor` → `pieSliceColors` on the >6 path** (L3) — xychart
   (`colors.ts:102`), journey (`renderer.ts:858-908`), mindmap (`renderer.ts:43`),
   gitgraph (`renderer.ts:193`); inherits pie's hue-spread.
5. **Translucent sequence activations** (L4) — `sequence/renderer.ts:361`; paint-only
   alpha so stacked activations read as depth.
6. **Fix timeline's scaffold-sketch outlier** (L2) — period stem role `period` →
   `marker-line`/`grid` (`timeline/renderer.ts:349`). Journey already does this right.
7. **Wrap-and-widen the journey title** (L5) — `journey/layout.ts:180-185,346`; the radar
   `titleLeftExtra/Right` template. (timeline title has the milder version.)
8. **Always-on bg-stroked vertex dots in xychart's static line path** (L4) —
   `xychart/renderer.ts:158-200`.
9. **Round gitgraph's orthogonal merge elbows into mild cubic bends** — `gitgraph/layout.ts:89-91`;
   `projectConnectorPath` (mindmap uses it at `renderer.ts:63`) is the ready tool.
10. **Translucent, optionally palette-tinted subgraph fills in flowchart/state** (L4) —
    `renderer.ts:269`; knob-gate the categorical hue (monochrome is a defensible
    control-flow default).

**Radar's own upgrade (the reverse flow applied to radar) — done.** Radar's static gutter
was upgraded to ER-style active de-collision (R1) + quadrant leaders (R2); ring values now
sit on knockout boxes with AA-gated ink (R5/R6); long labels compress to a budget (R4); and
legend labels wrap with reserved rows (R3). Renders and tests in §3.

## 5. Every family reviewed against the union

`✅` present/strong · `⚠️` partial or degrades · `❌` absent (and would help) ·
`N/A` no referent for this family. Columns are the union concerns (L-numbers from §1).

| Family | L1 sig-shape sketch | L2 scaffold recedes | L3 shared hue | L4 translucent + bead | L5+R label discipline | L6 one-scale | L7 wire-or-warn | L8 ASCII parity | Top opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **radar** (ref) | ✅ pie-slice | ✅ grid | ✅ canonical | ✅ | ✅ **full union** (§3) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Delivered — de-collision, leaders, knockout ticks, wrap compression, legend rows |
| **pie** | ✅ pie-slice | N/A | ✅ **canonical** | N/A (no overlap) | ✅ largest-first | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Default a quiet framing ring (`renderer.ts:126`) |
| **xychart** | ✅ bar/series | ✅ grid @0.25 | ⚠️ `getSeriesColor` (>6 degrades) | ⚠️ dots only if labelled | ⚠️ thins/drops, no wrap | ✅ `yAxis.range` | ✅ | ✅ | `pieSliceColors` >6 (`colors.ts:102`); always-on dots (`renderer.ts:158`) |

| **flowchart/state** | ✅ node/group/note | ✅ subgraphs recede | ❌ monochrome (by design) | ❌ opaque subgraphs | ✅✅ **knockout box + repair** | ✅ | ✅ inline style | ✅ | **Translucent subgraph fills** (`renderer.ts:269`) |
| **architecture** | ✅ except **icons (raw)** | ✅ header band | ❌ mono (bespoke opt-in) | ✅ junction bead / ❌ opaque group | ✅ box+title reserve | ✅ | ✅ `--arch-*` | ✅ | **Sketch icons** (`renderer.ts:505`); round edge chip |
| **er** | ✅ except **crow's-foot** | ✅ header band | ❌ mono (by convention) | ✅ zero-circle bead / ❌ opaque | ✅✅ **active de-collision** | N/A | ✅ classDef | ✅ | **Sketch/exempt crow's-foot** (`renderer.ts:639`) |

**The single recurring L1 gap across the boxed/graph families is identical:** each
sketches its boxes and connectors but leaves one class of *small semantic glyph* opted
out — architecture **icons**, er **crow's-feet**, class **UML markers**, mindmap **node
body**, gitgraph **commit markers**. Radar's rule (*the sketch marks the measurement; the
dot shares the curve's treatment*) argues these decorators should share their parent's
treatment, or be exempted on purpose. That is the highest-leverage, most cross-family
consistent improvement available.

---

## 6. Honesty ledger — where the union does NOT transfer

- **Translucent silhouettes (L4)** presuppose *overlapping area* marks. No referent for
  discrete-node structural families (mindmap trees, flowchart/state, architecture/er/class
  boxes) or non-overlapping marks (pie wedges, one-per-row gantt bars, journey/timeline
  bands). Opaque / lighten-toward-bg is correct there. Gantt's alpha is *semantic* (fading
  completed work), not a gap.
- **Categorical hue (L3)** does not apply where there is no series concept (sequence) and is
  a legitimate choice to omit in the monochromatic structural families (architecture/er/class)
  and control-flow (flowchart/state). Recommend it there only as an opt-in accent.
- **Single-scale contract (L6)** is *vacuous* for families with no numeric value-axis
  (sequence, journey's fixed 1–5, timeline, boxed families) — satisfied, not a gap.
- **The BOX-BOX overlap exemption (L10)** transfers *only* to genuinely interpenetrating,
  same-scale, non-`<path>` primitives (sequence activations, radar rings/beads). For every
  other family, primitive interpenetration is a real defect — the exemption must never be
  used to silence it. Prefer drawing intrinsic fills as `<path>` (invisible to the box
  parser, needing no exemption) instead.
- **Restrained legend (L4/§4)** is N/A where there is no categorical series to key —
  though quadrant and gantt would *gain* one once they gain categorical color.
- **The deterministic rubric measures only a hygiene floor** (finite, on-canvas, boxes
  don't overlap, groups tile, labels present). It never scores recession, translucent blend,
  silhouette legibility, or palette harmony. Passing `bun run track` with score 100 proves a
  family didn't break the floor; it does not certify beauty (L9). Beauty still requires a
  per-family aesthetic thesis.

---

## 7. Process lesson

The load-bearing artifact in #161 was the **aesthetic thesis** written *before* the code
("the silhouette IS the message"), which turned a spec-compliant chart into a beautiful
one, then hardened via independent audit ("fix root causes rather than weaken tests").
Any family improvement from §4/§5 should be driven by the equivalent one-line thesis —
*what is this diagram's message, and what makes it legible in <2s?* — not by chasing
rubric points. The rubric certifies you didn't break the floor while doing it; the roles
(§0) give you the ceiling for free.
